With great pomp and ceremony, he left his home and went to the temple. He met with the head monk, who agreed to let him study kung fu at the temple. The rich man shaved his head and donned the robes and was led to a room containing a well and a barrel of water. The monk told him to slap the surface of the water with his palm until no water remained in the barrel. The rich man didn\\'t understand, but did as he was told. He slapped the water with his palm and a little water splashed onto the floor. He repeated the slapping for what seemed like hours until no water remained. He found the monk and told him he had finished. The monk instructed him to fill the barrel again and repeat the task. This scene repeated for days. Eventually, the rich son stopped going to the monk and just refilled the barrel without being told. He grew angry. He suspected he was the butt of a cruel joke, and that the monks would never teach him kung fu but he knew that if he returned to his family having only slapped water he would be a laughingstock. Eventually, the seasons changed and the rich son returned home for the holiday feast. His family was so proud of him for studying kung fu, even though he was secretly ashamed that he had not received even one day\\'s instruction. \"What kung fu did you learn? What did they teach you?\" his family asked, eagerly. \"They didn\\'t teach me anything,\" he mumbled. \"Oh, you are so modest, tell us what they taught you!\" they urged.

The background checks are a joke and the company definitely puts profit before customer safety in my opinion. I live in Burlington, VT and the city had to come to a strict agreement with Uber not to hire people with DUI's or sex offenses after an Uber driver was accused of sexual assault on a drunk passenger. It's ridiculous that the city would have to force Uber to make that an official policy, but then I came to find out that there is essentially no oversight of taxi companies here at all. They've been caught having drivers with DUI's, sex offenses, licenses suspended and a myriad of things you would assume would get you fired immediately. And if they are fired, what do they do? Move on to the next cab company. The judicial process takes far too long to remove specific drivers or revoke a companies license. I assume it's the same in many cities and legislators should update whatever laws to create some kind of checks and balances. It's common sense. Personally, I've had several cabbies make weird, sexual comments to females I was riding with. Most people are non-confrontational, so they'll try to politely deflect a creepy comment to avoid an awkward situation. I'll just tell them to their face they're being weird and inappropriate and it's always met with bewilderment, like they're just making small talk. They'll shut up eventually, but I can't imagine what it would be like as a female, alone in that situation. Especially at night when most passengers are leaving the bars, probably drunk. It's definitely a problem that needs to be dealt with in this city, but based on the way politics move here I doubt they'll do anything until someone actually gets assaulted or killed.\": 1,\n"," 'A golden retriever and her puppies': 1,\n"," 'The New Patch Is Here!': 1,\n"," 'The one time I start Amat...': 1,\n"," 'Are you a boy, or a girl?': 1,\n"," 'Tea bag to show dominance.

Not now. Not in the next life. I was watching the documentary \"Prophets Prey\" which describes life in the polygamist communities of Texas and Short Creek that are under the control of the FLDS Church in Warren Jeffs. One sociological flaw that I never seriously considered, but seems so obvious, is the ratio of men to women. In order for FLDS leaders to take multiple wives, a good chunk of the men have to be kicked out of the community (since a small select group of men are hoarding all the women). Let\\'s suppose for a minute that Joseph Smith truly was a prophet and inspired by God to reveal the celestial order of marriage, which is plural marriage. If that were true, then the **majority of men will have no place** in the celestial kingdom and will not even be permitted to have a female companion for all eternity, as they will be hoarded by a select group of men. The ratios are much more dire then you\\'d expect, but again are really quite obvious mathematically. Let\\'s say the average man has five wives. That would mean **80% of all men would have no place in heaven**. That\\'s worse than the 1/3 that were supposedly kicked out before earth life. Yes the ratios are closer to what Joseph Smith and Brigham Young followed, only one in 48 men have a shot a heaven. That means 98 percent have their wife taken away (like property) and reassigned to a man who only sleeps with her once every six weeks. If life in America has taught you anything, it\\'s not your odds of ending up in the 1% are pretty low. Like a 1 and 100 shot. So the odds are pretty good that your wife is going to be taken away and reassigned to some dirtbag apostle or something.

Europe is not North America. North America has only a few countries to deal with and amazing transparency between borders and amalgamation of systems. Our systems are designed to work together and talk to each other, seamlessly. Europe is not that way, even today the geopolitical realities means there\\'s a lot of mismatch between countries that are all over the place relative to each other. Not to mention the sheer number of countries and regulations and systems. A tiny problem in one can bring the whole damn system down. People want simple answers, maybe Riot doesn\\'t have one, maybe the answer is so insanely technical that sharing it would be meaningless to anyone who\\'s not a network engineer. Maybe they don\\'t even know the problem. The problem may not be in their control, and they may not even have the ABILITY to discover the problem. However telling the fanbase \"we don\\'t know what the problem is and probably never will\" is not an answer that will make anyone happy, so they say \"we\\'re working on it\" and do what they can. Riot is not \"out to get Europe\". That is utterly nonsensical. What would they stand to gain from giving most of a continent sub-par service? If they knew what the problem was and could fix it, they would have already done so. The fact that they have not should be evidence enough of this. As for why you cannot discuss it in forums and on the subreddit, it\\'s because it does nothing to further the discussion. None of you know the problem either, so it\\'s not like balancing discussions where valid ideas can emerge from the community. No one is going to write a post that makes Riots engineers go \"OF COURSE! That\\'s it!\". Instead each of these threads descend into circle-jerks of complaining and conspiracies about Riot\\'s hatred of Europe. There\\'s nothing TO discuss, what you want is to vent. Venting is not actually useful, catharsis has been disproved as a psychological theory a long time ago. All it is is toxicity and negativity, so it\\'s not useful to the community. Everyone knows the EUW servers are troubled, this is not news to anyone. And that\\'s why the problem hasn\\'t been fixed and why you can\\'t talk about it.

The problem is that the cycle has been accelerated by humans to occur unnaturally. History of our planet has never seen this type of acceleration before, and what is difficult is trying to determine what effects this will have on the planet. For example, if climate change use to take 500,000 years to go from -20C to 20C, that gave animals 500,000 years to adapt, move locations, evolve to the difference in temperature. Now let's say that humans' impact on the planet will cause the same change (-20C to 20C) in only 50,000 years. Species which are use to adapting over 500,000 years now only have 50,000 to adapt.

We realize we are the new kids on the block, but as you can see, by grinding wins over the past 9 weeks we have truly earned our spot in the LCS for what will hopefully be many seasons to come. In G2 everyone is family, and our League of Legends players and coach have worked extremely hard since the beginning of this year to prove all the naysayers wrong and contest for a top 3 spot in the first split. Here we are at the end of the regular split and our team have earned 1st place with a 15-3 record, ahead of a very strong field of teams. On behalf of the entire G2 fam, I hope you will ignore the ocelote of past, and instead join me in congratulating our players Perkz, Hybrid, Kikis, Trick, Emperor &amp; coach Youngbuck on a regular split that far exceeded everyone's expectations (including my own, not gonna lie) and continue to show your support as we fight for glory in Rotterdam in just a few weeks.
